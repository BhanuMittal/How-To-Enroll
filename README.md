## Set up Git

### Instructions for Mac:

1. Install Git if you haven't already: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#Installing-on-Mac.  

### Instructions for Windows:

1. Apologies in advance since these are significantly more annoying than the instructions for Mac. If you have any problems or questions let me know!  
2. Install GitHub for Windows: https://desktop.github.com/  
3. Open Command Prompt (go to your search bar, search for "Command Prompt" and open it).  
4. In the Command Prompt, type "dir git.exe /s /p" and press enter on your keyboard.  
5. The command prompt will search for a little while and then output a few lines. One of the lines will look like "Directory of C:\Users[YOUR_USERNAME]\AppData\Local\GitHub\PortableGit_[RANDOM_LETTERS_AND_NUMBERS]\cmd" You will know it's the right line since it will end in "cmd"  
6. Highlight that line and copy it.  
7. Open Android Studio  
8. Select "File," and then "Settings."  
9. In the window that appears, select "Version Control" and then "Git" on the left sidebar.  
10. At the top of the window, you will see a field named "Path to Git executable." Paste the line you copied earlier there, and at the end of it, add "\git.exe" so the final line looks something like: C:\Users[YOUR_USERNAME]\AppData\Local\GitHub\PortableGit_[RANDOM_LETTERS_AND_NUMBERS]\cmd\git.exe  
11. Click "Test." It should say everything was successful! If not, let us know.  
12. Click "Apply" and then "OK" in the bottom right hand corner of the window.
